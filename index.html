                <h3>Internet of Things(IoT)</h3>
            <p>
                The Internet of things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such objects) with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.[1][2][3][4][5] Internet of things has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet, they only need to be connected to a network,[6] and be individually addressable.[7][8]

                The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, increasingly powerful embedded systems, as well as machine learning.[9] Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of things.[10] In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems, cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. IoT is also used in healthcare systems.[11]
                
                There are a number of concerns about the risks in the growth of IoT technologies and products, especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently, industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun, including the development of international and local standards, guidelines, and regulatory frameworks.[12]

                <h4>Machine Learning(ML)</h4>
                <p>
                    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It is a rapidly growing field with applications in various industries and domains.

                    The core idea behind machine learning is to enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. Instead of following a predefined set of rules, machine learning algorithms use statistical techniques to analyze and find patterns within data, allowing the system to make predictions, classify information, or perform tasks based on the learned patterns.
                
                    There are different types of machine learning algorithms, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning:
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Machine learning has a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, financial forecasting, healthcare diagnostics, and much more. It continues to advance rapidly due to the availability of large datasets, increased computing power, and advancements in algorithms and techniques.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's worth noting that while machine learning algorithms can automatically learn and make predictions, they still require careful data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation to ensure optimal performance and reliable results.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overall, machine learning is a powerful approach that enables computers to learn from data and make intelligent decisions, making it a key technology in the development of AI systems.
